# Humanities & Data Science Discussion Group

First and foremost, Welcome! ðŸŽ‰

This repository is to develop, store and maintain resources for the Humanities & Data Science (HDS) Discussion Group. 
This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project.

We have been organising and hosting discussion sessions to explore imporant topics that are in the intersection of humanities and data science.
Attendees of this interest group are from The Alan Turing Institute, University College London, British Library and their colleagues, interested in the topics of discussion.

As we gain momentum in this project and test different formats to run our discussion sessions, we understand that there might be more people who would like to get involved in the discussions or read notes from these sessions. If you would like to get involved or share ideas to make resources from these session available for wider audience, please get in touch with the maintainers of this repository and members of the organisation group, Federico Nanni, Leontien Talboom, Malvika Sharan and Katherine L. McDonough by opening an [issue](https://github.com/fedenanni/HDS-DiscussionGroup/issues) on this repository.

If you would like to help with any of the issues raised in this repository or have other ideas for contributions, please check out our [contributors' guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
