:dart: Quick Questions
---
*Feel free to answer them or add a '+1' next to a statement that you agree with and/or would like to discuss*


**In which cases do you post a preprint of your work?**

*Name / response*

- Dmytro / Anytime, unless my collaborators are against it
- Leontien / Never, it is not common in my field
- Jessica / Always (except some commissioned review articles)
- Adam T / faster access (post-acceptance)
- David B / does final author copy count here? i.e. to satisfy open access - where it's mandadted by funder 
- Martin O / Pre-submission or post-acceptance (depending on journal policy) if journal paper is not open access, as I always want a freely available copy. I'd like to move my default to pre-submission pre-print as standard practice
- Callum / I publish a pre-print at paper submission. Primarily for faster access since the review process can be so sluggish sometimes. I also like that the review process is then transparent (if the paper changes a lot from pre-print to journal article).
- Amy Tabb / most of the time when publishing w/ CS/ECE researchers.

**And when you don't?**

*Name / response*

- Dmytro / Only if co-authors are not allowed to.
- Jessica / Review article requested by the journal (depending on journal policy)
- Alessandro / In our field (organisation studies) it is extremely uncommon to do it alltogether. Multiple journals ask you to take it down (few do it nonetheless) and some do not accept articles already posted online
- Amy Tabb / when the lead authors are not in favor and/or it is not in the discipline's tradition (entomology).


**How do you select which new preprints to read?**

*Name / response*

- Leontien / Mainly shared by people on Twitter [name=DavidB] +1 [name=Martin O] +1
- Dmytro/ http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/, twitter
- Jessica / Twitter - we have cataloged some efforts here: https://reimaginereview.asapbio.org/explore/?search_keywords=preprint&sort=latest
- Amy Tabb / twitter

**Do you ever question your approach?**

*Name / response*

- Dmytro / No. I thought about it a lot, but cannot find reasons not to for myself.
- Amy Tabb / Also no.  Preprinting has been very positive for my work and allows me to transfer the technology.

**Do you then regularly read the final paper when it is published?**

*Name / response*

- David B / Nope, things have often moved on well before. Makes it tricky as what to cite, the preprint or the final
- Leontien / Depends on the type of work it is, as some work will be outdated quite quickly
- Dmytro / rarely, mostly if it is updated on arXiv and the paper is very relevant to me
- Jessica / we have recommended that preprint servers implement changelog in metadata, would be good to see this for journals as well: https://asapbio.org/biopreprints2020-report
- Demitra/ At F1000Research we combine the preprint with the open post-pub peer review process, with all versions linked and an ammendement box explaining what has changed between versions
- Amy Tabb / not frequently because of access issues.

The Current and Future Role of Preprints Across Research Communities

Preprints - scholarly or scientific papers that precedes formal peer review and publication in a peer-reviewed scholarly or scientific journal. Some communities use it a lot more than others, also there has been a paid increase of preprints in the last decades.

Why publish preprints?
- Increased visibility
- Increased citations
- Faster dissemnation of results
- May prevent scooping
- It migh be an easy way to wrap-up a side project
- Bypassing paywall

Anna discusses the behaviour in NLP regarding preprints. Main point of preprints here is to try and get results out faster. Preprints can be very different from the published version, Anna gives an example of her own work which turned out completely different than the initial preprint. She talks about how even if the published paper turns out much better, not a lot of people revisit it. 
Dmytro disagrees, and talks about the fact that he does read an updated version if it is published. 
Martin would love to see how a preprint can change over time, a change log would be very helpful with that. Are they even still the same paper over time?

There are very few journals in the life sciences that point to the preprints. Jessica talks about how journals should acknowledge that preprints exist.

Some fields seem to be more comfortable citing preprints than other fields. In NLP citations for preprints seem to be more common than citing the actual published work. 

Across our different disciplines there are different approaches to editing and finishing off the final version of a published paper. 

Another point that we touched upon is the sheer amount of preprints and this slightly touches on the topic of trust of preprints. How do you select them? What approach is used here? 

Demitra from F1000 Research talks about how she approaches different disciplines. They are looking at the differences between fields, for examples, for some fields you need a PhD to be considered an expert, whilst others view a Master's degree as sufficient. Because the reviews are open and citable, it encourages people to do a better job at reviewing. 

Dmytro is concerned about if early career researchers do an open critical reviews, which could impact their career. Demitra talks about how you can team up and protect yourself from these types of situations. 

Preprints is increasing the speed of research, but does this push research into a certain direction? And is that the direction that you want to go in? Is this harmful for the research community? 

Jessica - making science openly accessible and make it possible for everyone to provide their expertise gives the writers a much better feedback than when using a more traditional peer-review approach. But the downside of this is that it is easier to disseminate misinformation.

Rennie, from a digital humanities background, takes an example of a journal from her field (Cultural Analytics). This journal is against preprints, because it can disrupt the blind peer-review process. Both Dmytro and Martin question why this process is blind. Anna would like to preserve anonymity, her blogpost about this is linked in the below section for more details. 

Alessandro talks about how his field does not perceive preprints very well, they are not very well known either. Also, the discussion is different depending on the research methods, qualitative and quantitative material will need different approaches. He closes about mentioning how we should rethink the journal process. 

:mag: Main arguments from the discussion
---
- Preprints may change drastically during the time of it being made available and when the actual paper is published. This rises questions around what is actually being cited, as the finished paper could be very different
- Peer review is perceived very differently across different fields. It is difficult to find the balance between giving researchers credit for this work, but also keeping people's reputation intact if they provide a critical review, especially if this is an early career researcher.
- The benefits of preprints differ across fields, in the section above some example have been given. However, there was a strong positive perception of publishing preprints. But some fields may be more used to using them than others.

Next aspects on the topic that we can discuss in further sessions:
* open peer review in the humanities
* preprints / working draft and qualitative research
* being a reviewer as a "job"
