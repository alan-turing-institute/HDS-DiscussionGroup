Non-English NLP. 

Lots of development working with non english language outside of the NLP community and in the DH. how do we approach working with non english material in these communities?

Problems:
- getting data
- developing methods
- sharing work
- how we teach

Significant differencies across centuries for many languages. Many NLP methods are developed to work in English, gaps in tools / software libraries for working in tools. Imperative to present in English is a problem, if there is no attention to linguistic diversity in the classroom then there will be a lack of it in the public sphere.

Why people work in other languages?

Quinn: Often there are no things out of the box that you can use, because most of the time these are things that are not really used in the NLP community.

Katie: the tools that are out there were terrible and don't work. 

Alex: dutch archeology pipeline is not generalisible and so very hard to publish

Serge: the diversity of language is quite large

the rise of multilingual method brings less language resources and for some tasks might work

Daniel: relation between business and law - if you have a model that assign a tag and works well in English, does this work well in another language

Serge: machine translation and multilingual transformers might work

Quinn: there is unavoilable labour for annotations. Often is non scalable

Katie: many complex and time consuming questions

Fede: find good annotators across languages is hard

Alex: there are many gray areas when working in other languages

Leontien: archival selection is approached with very engineering way

Serge: simple engineering solutions might be a starting point to enable language-specific research

Katie: what are typical problems when teaching multilingual NLP?

Quinn: words are not words and sentences are not sentences. 

Katie: certain type of linguistic work in the humanities are easier to do when working in english compard
