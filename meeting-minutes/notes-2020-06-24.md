:dart: Discussion Goal
---

Commercial Digitalisation is not a library, or are they?

Example 1:
- National archives have agreement with "Findmypast" to secure records on ancestory
- pro- Findmypast does the digitalisation and preserves the data in different format
- Con- this is available only upon visiting the national archive reading room, but to access them from home there is a paywall for access

Example 2:
- Googlebooks: Digital bookstores are not library
- they are copyright and authors don't benefit from them
- You need to pay to access the books and hence its google that profits from this and not society

Example 3:
- Internet archive - not library but piracy as there is no license to make these books available

Questions:


2.  What are the drawbacks of commercial organisation acting in this environment?
- As their main goal is to make money, how do we ensure that our values also come across?
- How do we guarantee long-term preservation? (when the hype is gone)
- If the business is based on data, how do we ensure that data is open and fully available?

3.  How should we be setting up such a relationship?
- Which value do we recognize in their work, apart from the invested budget?
- How can we ensure that our expertise is not lost?
- Or is it something that academia should discourage as a whole?

:mag: Main arguments from the discussion
---

**Questions 1.**  What are the benefits of commercial organisation acting in this environment?
- How would we otherwise fund large digitisation projects?
- Does this mean the material is more widely available?
- Does this simplify cross-country efforts?

**Discussion on Google books and British Library (BL) contract on digitalisation of literature**:
- Google books: https://books.google.com/
    - What are their business model? - very unclear to library and archives 
    - Rossitza: Google Books are still going, and digitising collections at the BL and other institutions
    - Daniel Wilson (in chat): As Rossitza said, they *are* digitising thousands of books a month: but the business model is more opaque.I assumed Google Books was meant to be a ‘loss leader’ for the wider operation: PR for their ambition to ‘organise all knowledge’ (aka advertising)
- A Lang (in chat): book historian Robert Darnton wrote a good piece on this in the NYRB some years ago (ironically enough, behind a paywall: http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22281)

Questions on Google digitalisation:
- Patricia Murrieta (in chat): what is the arrangement between the BL and them Rossitza? In terms of what you get and what do they get?
    - The contract is available online, it is quite inflexible https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/access-to-the-agreement-between-google-books-and-the-british-library/
- What are they interested in digitalising? What kind of material? Just speculating what's their goal :D
    - Curators had the freedom to select materials but there are restrictions on dimension and condition to meet the requirements of the scanning equipment Google use
    - A lot of the books can be rejected if the metadata is missing
    - There is a focus on scale than content, e.g. a request to digitalise some specific material was rejected because metadata was missing and BL did not have the resources
    - The goal seem to be text mining and OCR ...
    - Libraries are having different dialogues with google group (separately), and it's not consistent
- Even if their goal is not the most charitable, how can communities benefit from it?
    - David Beavan (in chat): They are hoovering up all of human knowledge. Born digital for them = web, they have got covered. This is a way of going back in time. Language models, semantic change, OCR, gateway to knowledge. If they become to de facto place for knowledge/search and put libraries out of business (even if only by convenience) then you’ll get adverts between page turns etc.etc. Google are ultimately a advertising company

- Daniel Wilson: there is one buyer and no competition. we need to understand what is that they gain from this, in order to value the resource they are being given. 
    - In any case, my point was more that the BL felt its hands were tied, even before it got to that point 

- Katie: ancestry free from local libraries in the UK during the pandemic. 
    - Geneology organisations hold a lot of power (personal information)
    - Based on where they are (America or UK), they also compete for information

- Patricia: It's in a way like publishing companies. In order to change the model, holders of knowledge would have to choose not to go with them...
- Mia: Other organisation can access Google Books, but they don’t mind the unlimited liability that Turing didn’t agree to

- Kate M (in chat): Is there any writing/research about which countries have provided public funding for digitization vs. those that have gone (at least primarily) with commercial digitization?

- Mia: Really great overview on the efforts of different countries in digitizing their cultural heritage (France, Finland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada) in comparison with the UK

:closed_book: Closing remarks/questions/topics (for future discussions!)
--

- In science we have a strong open movement on the basis that the Tax payers (public funding) going into research should produce output that is publicly accessible. 
    - However, that kind of funding is missing in humanities which is shocking given the fact that humanities affects generations of scholars, researchers, politicians and citizens.
    - What we have also realised that some of the researchers work on a field not because that's what they want to do, but because that's the only field they can access paper on - I wonder if that pattern exists within humanities as well.
    - The embargo for IP rights on research output are same across all these fields
