:dart: Discussion Goal
---

- The focus will be on the benefits and drawbacks of tutorials enabling humanities scholars to easily use data science methods.


:mag: Main arguments from the discussion
---

1.  Tutorials are useful for very specific tasks, to learn what a tool could/should do, not necessarily to learn data science. They are a first step into the field, but from the discussion it became apparent that it is easier to learn data science from books, courses or internships.

2.  Different methodological frameworks between science and humanities education. We talked about whether data science will ever become part of humanities curricula, due to the demand from students which see it necessary for entering the job market. We had a comparison with the training in biology, a science that (partly) relies on qualitative methods. 

3.  Tutorials often donâ€™t have an interactive component (compared to working in groups). This leads to less of a community feeling; also it is unclear how reliable they generally are. The Programming Historian addresses many of these issues, with peer-review, frequent updates and an active Twitter community.
