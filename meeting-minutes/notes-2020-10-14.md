# Notes: 14 October, 2020

## Topic

- Ethical implications of archiving the web, especially social media

## Aim of this meeting

- We would like to talk about the benefits and drawbacks of guaranteeing long-term access to this type of material, focusing in particular on the dichotomy between authorial consent and historical preservation.

- Here’s a few starting points for the discussion:
  - [Guest Editorial: Reflections on the Ethics of Web Archiving](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15332748.2018.1517589)
  - [We Could, but Should We? Ethical Considerations for Providing Access to GeoCities and Other Historical Digital Collections](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/11649/Milligan_etal_JCDL2016%281%29-s.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)

:mag: Main arguments from the discussion
---
The discussion started with a few examples of how archiving of social media is done in practice, covering the UK Government Web Archive, Bellingcat and Document the Now.
 - UK Government Web Archive is archiving YouTube and Twitter for example from government pages. They are only able to archive the original content, none of the comments or other community parts of it.
 - Document the Now doesn't archive themselves but offers a set of tools to empower people to archive material online.
 - Bellingcat does archive the context around it, sometimes this being private or confidential information. But they archive it as evidence, which is a slightly different purpose.

Starting question was around the difference between archiving and capturing social media. This then led to the British Library (BL) outlining their approach to archiving social media. They also talk about the Legal Deposit, as this limits them from archiving at scale. Another question was asked around the UK content and how this should be determined, as these boundaries may not be as visible on the web.

Then there was a discussion around metadata, especially focusing on losing context, such as the UK Government Web archive, only capturing what the government does online. BL keep specific metadata with their material to preserve the context, but what is considered enough and what are we actually capturing?

Although the discussion may not have given concrete answers to what should and shouldn't be archived. It was good to hear people's different approaches to this and what their problems they encountered when doing this type of work. 

### Additional Drafted Notes 
<!-- Other important details discussed during the meeting can be entered here. -->

We will start from a few examples on how this is done in practice.

- The UKGWA archives twitter, youtube and trying facebook
- They keep the tweets (no context / retweets / comments) 

Another example is the Document the Now (they don't archive material themselves) but offer tools 
- Bellingcat is an investigate journalist company. They use social media to debunk certain things - examples on Covid misinformation
- They have a more don't ask for permission but ask for forgiveness.

Is it useful to archive

- difference between archiving and capture
- from BL. Archiving social media preserving the entire life cycle. Legal deposit - they don't archive social media at scale.

How to assess what is UK content?
- Heretrix used for archiving at scale - not suited for archiving at scale
- The UKGWA doesn't keep dynamic nature of social media
- Losing context around the tweet
- UKWeb Archive at BL tries to get context from metadata
- Social media material is as much as possible publicly avaiable (you would need an additional permission from the content owner)
- what do we create when we doing it? What are we capturing? (who archives social media at scale?)
- build social network from the XVIII century through letters - you can do that, but it is not there in the same form
- what are we preserving and why?
- Research on social media - but how did you collect them?
- Discussion around anonymisation / deanonymisation
- And the role of the archive in this - it could act as a collaborator for the researchers for guaranteeing the way data is collected
- Prioritisation from the archivist point of view. This is usually not a priority
- Technical expertise are needed
- We can run the code from our holdings
- CommonCrawl / Internet Archive are available so people can run their code first there 
- document the process of how data has been collected
- question for the researchers: what do they want?

Discussion around preserving cross-national events
- the distinction between private and public is dissolved now - the social context is all mixed together
- discussion about the role of BL on archiving and making available
- archiving newsletter? discusses how BL archives currently Weibo
- moving more into a contracting out to the users the type of contents to preserver
- who makes the choice? Delegating to the crowd
- but are we replicating the old model?
- people are already contacting the BL for preserving their online activities before 

Discussion on who to communicate to the crawler what you should not
