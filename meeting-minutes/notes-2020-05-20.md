# Notes: 20 May, 2020

## Aim of this meeting

- Having a conversation rather than a one-to-many reading group
- Discussing topics at the intersections of the two disciplines
- Trying to consider different / uncommon points of view
- Chatting over lunch (a tea / beer) to make it as informal and relaxed as possible
- Trying to have this the first Wednesday of every month (up for discussion) 

### Topic

- The Computational Humanities and Toxic Masculinity? A (long) reflection ([Original blogpost](https://latex-ninja.com/2020/04/19/the-computational-humanities-and-toxic-masculinity-a-long-reflection/), [Our slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11qi43HYFjogFJV36u2pS0CPLqP43d_Ypvv4pYvxuKVY/edit?usp=sharing))
    - Katie McDonough (from Living with Machines) will introduce the topic and Fede chairs the debate.

### Initial Drafted Notes 
<!-- Important details discussed during the meeting can be entered here. -->

Here's we can collaboratively take notes of the main passages of the conversation, that we can then organize as below.
- Does the computational skill denote to some power structure? - is it assumed to be masculin (and hence exclude women or other genders)
    - Digital humanity has grown out of humantities wby techie people, similarly computational humanity seem to have come out of folks in computation who are interested in humanities - not sure if that's what creates a niche (Comment from Zoom: Does CH vs DH play back into long disproved stereotypes of The Two Cultures? Or is it different from wethat?)
    - A lot of the points that is in the blog post echoes human right approach that people in legal space talk about
    - Problem of binaries: techie - fuzzy divide (technies are engineers and fuzzy are historian and literature folks) that separates intellectual community in a campus
    - There is a gendered aspects indeed that exist in many research spaces and as a research community we should think about how do we manage these privileges and power dynamics
- By the author on what led her to draft the post
    - The motivation comes from the lack of full understanding of what Computational Humanity actually stood for
    - In many languages this as a field doesn't exist
    - She noticed that some jobs in humanities are offered to computer scientists because they can do machine learning and a qualified humanities specialist might not 
    - Many conference only highlight computational visualisation and not so much on humanities
    - Women and men will have same chances to get selected if they work on the same topic, but what if a field is also gender biased and that's the field that gets more focus
- Privilege hazard: when you have privilege you don't see the problem
    - Often people get offended by people pointing out less privilege. They are afraid to speak up, and therefore having a safe space is useful.

- How power dynamics influence the way we do research
    - When working in science there is an attitude of "verificationism" - as people who don't have the same lived experience want to understand what others are talking about (putting yourself in the shoes of other genders) - this causes frustrations to both sides of debaters

- People come for a value but stay for the ethos
    - How is DH formed, and what aspects are being considered?
    - Why is a separate community being formed? 

- Melvin: I think it's not a clear separation, in our view it's more like a special interest / subcommunity within the larger community
- James: Glen, It may also be different in the different regionalities of DH, where there are difference focuses. 
- James: Sarah, Maybe the perception of marginalisation is something we all have but to more/lesser degrees?


### Some comments from the chat

- From James Cummings to Everyone: (4:32 pm): I'm not sure women have the same chance of getting accepted to a conference. At least that isn't what the statistics over a long period seem to show. There is a PI-goes-to-the-conference, and then far too many of those are still men.
- From Ismael to Everyone: (4:34 pm): Having zero background in computational or digital humanities, I only learned the term when I saw this discussion advertised! I am happy to see the definitions are vague - I have a feeling that defining what either one is (or clarifying that they are the same) could be a first step (setting aside the enormous social background through which all concepts, names, etc. are interpreted for a moment)
- From Jez Cope to Everyone: (4:35 pm): My gut reaction is "we need to investigate this more" too, but I'm also aware that attitude tends to perpetuate the status quo, both because you don't have to change anything until you've investigated, but but also there's a danger of confirmation bias
- From James Cummings to Everyone: (4:36 pm): Ismael: There is a long history (and publications like 'Defining DH') on what is or isn't DH. I've learned from experience when someone claims they are doing DH it isn't my place to say whether that is real 'DH' or not. ;-)
- From quinn dombrowski to Everyone: (4:37 pm): On representation in conference acceptance, there's this paper on DH (through 2015) which suggests underrepresentation https://scottbot.net/representation-at-digital-humanities-conferences-2000-2015/ 
- Sarah: Thanks! I think this is a good summary of where I wanted to go with the post - I get how continuous feminism debates can be somewhat annoying to men, but it's just like Laura said- if you have the priviledge, you can't just "see" the perspective of those who doN#t
- From quinn dombrowski to Everyone: (4:42 pm) If the stats reflect fewer women submitting, isn't that a problem too? 
- From Arianna Ciula to Everyone: (4:42 pm) My reactions: names ARE important, names often mean identity especially at certain stages in life (e.g. early career);  society has problems with diversity (just look at figures on salaries across sectors); DH/RSE/Computational Humanities are right to question/problematise names and question bias/problemitise reifications of societal bias/problems; however you would assume we had figured out by now that instrumental and intellectual are entangled - if itsn’t this community who can articulate it best, who else?
- james - Yeah, we are way passed having to ask women to prove they don't feel comfortable/experience misogyny. Just believe them. (But also, forgive us privileged if we forget EDI sometimes. Prod us when we do.)
- From James Cummings to Everyone: (5:02 pm): (Hopefully we'll eventually get to a place where we don't need prodding, it is normal.)
- From Melvin Wevers to Everyone: (5:03 pm): @sarah, I see how in the grant-world, traditional hum is threatened by computational approaches. But having a community dealing with issues related to communities is not necessarily set up as something that invalidates this field of scholarship, communities = computation
- From James Smithies to Everyone: (5:03 pm): Thanks to the organisers and everyone who shared their thoughts - really valuable for me.
