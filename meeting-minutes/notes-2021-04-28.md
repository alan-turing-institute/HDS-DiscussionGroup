### :dart: Quick Question

*Feel free to answer or add a '+1' next to a statement that you agree with and/or would like to discuss*

**What is your experience with open-source journalism? Do you think it could be of any help for your discipline? If so, why?**

*Name / response*

* David / Along with Camila here on the call, I'm part of [Turing Data Stories](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/TuringDataStories): a mix of open data, code, narrative üí¨, visuals üìäüìà and knowledge üß† to help understand the world around us.
  * Blatent self promo: Come join us, with stories, data, ideas and community building
  * [name=Camila] üôå YASS!
* Ismael / Not very much, but I spoke with the Comms team today and it was interesting to hear how things have changes during the pandemic, as journalists now just look out for preprints. See Fox ([2020](https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/what-should-press-officers-advise-on-preprints-during-a-pandemic/)).
* David / One of my fave exhibitions ever was [Forensic Architecture](https://forensic-architecture.org/) '...undertake advanced spatial and media investigations into cases of human rights violations, with and on behalf of communities affected by political violence, human rights organisations, international prosecutors, environmental justice groups, and media organisations.'
* Camila: One of my main source for Venezuelan news comes from a [OSINT account](https://twitter.com/conflictsw) that can't be censored by the regime. It is been extremely useful to know what is happening in certain events. 
* Malvika: Positive journalism in the context of citizen science (researcher's night, road show, data reporting, blogging) and negative journalism in the context of public shaming of people social media (twitter trends on open source related news - current one on basecamp).
    * I am thinking more in the direction of peer-reviewing of news where ideas are represented fairly (a more wholesome view of world event rather than living in a bubble).
* Andre: I'm a journalist by background and I'm running a project with the Bureau Local (a branch of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism) that works with a lot of open source or citizen journalism principles. The project I'm running is a collaboration with Coney (interactive theatre company) and they are working on innovative community engagement, investigation, storytelling and impact strategies. The idea is that this could help both organisations to tell contemporary stories that matter to people co-creating with communities. It is based on the idea that traditional journalism is extractive of society and it needs to work better for communities affected by the issues that journalists cover. **For reference**: [FT's The Uber Game](https://ig.ft.com/uber-game/)
* Katie: I am familiar with a couple of projects at the Spatial History Project at Stanford that are nice combinations of mapping/data viz and journalist- and documentarian-driven projects. For ex: http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/project.php?id=1045
* Giovanni / No real experience but curious about the value as a source, both for current affairs and Social Science, but also within a more classic "historical source" framing. I wonder how much notions of legacy/obsolescence of the journalistic open-data are discussed within these groups.   


### ‚úç Initial Drafted Notes

*anyone can help taking notes.*
<!-- All things discussed during the meeting can be entered here. -->

- Starting point on Boston bombing and picking the wrong suspect (discussion from online forums like Reddit). 
During the last 5 years open source journalist as a counter movement to alt-facts. 
- Transparency as a key aspect - very very clear where they got their sources from and there's lots of help from the public. Example of Bellingcat on geolocating picture. Open discussion is public around information. 
- S. Sharoff: texts published by non by professional journalist but by everyday people. The format and style is often similar but the type of content is different. 
The founder of Bellingcat is not a journalist. 
Andrea: she is trained as a journalist, but it's not the education that makes you a journalist, more about the prcatice.
- Andrea: internship is again learning through practice instead of professional training (trust in editing)
    - Open source journalism is about building accountability. Quicker response to any concern compared to established outlet.
- S. Sharoff: there are some linguistic differences in the way information is presented. often opinions and third-person viewpoints are not mixed. Fake news spreading often these are more personal 
- Andr√© Piza: open-source journalism has a great impact on organisation. they recognise that there's a big change in the field
- Andrea: the role of citisen journalism in anti-democratic countries. 
- Malvika: open-source journalism and open-source development. Transparency seems to be the key. Peer reviewing, challenging the power imbalance and allowing users to become contributors.
    - Here they define if blogging can be called open source journalism: [https://www.upstart.net.au/explainer-open-source-journalism/](https://www.upstart.net.au/explainer-open-source-journalism/)
* Crowdsourcing data and stories: 
- Dave: transparency is the main aspect. Bellingcat is based on open source data. Traditional journalism doesn't show the sources and the flow so clearly ("protecting sources").
- Katie: writing about research and writing about journalism. Training graduate students how to write to non academics about their research - often it is done to replace the comms stuff.   
- Dave: Turing Data Stories: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/TuringDataStories
- Andre: Crowdsourcing data and stories: https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/blog/2021-04-14/a-blueprint-for-investigative-journalism-how-the-bureau-worked-alongside-riders-to-investigate-deliveroo
- Leontien: FullFact and it's not about being trusted, it's about being trustworthy. 
- Serge: writing is for an audience and for different audiences you'll have different messages.
- Andrea: the audience is more differentiated than just age. Older demographies are more exposed to fake news
- Camila: youtube as first source of news for young people. 
- Andre: from 2019 social media is not anymore growing as source of news and also trust in people is changing.
